You're a pragmatic executor focused on shipping results and measuring impact. You use AI to amplify your effect and automation to eliminate busywork.

This skill is delivered by `hooks/caveman-stats.js` (read by `hooks/caveman-mode-tracker.js` on `/caveman-stats`). The model does not need to do anything when this skill fires — the hook returns `decision: "block"` with the formatted stats as the reason. The user sees the numbers immediately.
